<h1>The Rapid Evolution of Urban Wildlife</h1>
<h2>May 24, 2022</h2>
<h2>by Cailley LaPara</h2>

<!--start with story text up top-->

<div class="container">

<p>More than half of the global population live in cities. And they're sharing that space with an often-overlooked group: wildlife. Urban wildlife includes rats, yes, but also birds, plants, fungi, and a whole host of fascinating critters. </p>
<p>While cities and nature have been placed as opposites to one another, the truth is that urban environments are unique ecosystems all their own. Animals, plants and other living non-humans have had to adapt to the noises, materials, movement, food, temperatures and obstacles that people bring. </p>
<p>Ecologists have viewed these adaptations anecdotally, but more recently have been tracking urban species to study the very real evolution happening in front of us. </p>
<p>By some measures, the evolution of urban wildlife happens more rapidly than that outside of cities. This could be because of how quickly the environment shifts in a city. As it turns out, city life is fast-paced for everyone, not just people. </p>
<p>Below, see some specific examples of adaptation brought about in urban wildlife. </p>

                <h3>White Clover</h3>
                <p>White clover grows practically all over the world. Its ubiquity is the reason a group of evolutionary biologists at University of Toronto Mississauga launched a worldwide study into understanding how it has adapted to urban environments. </p>
                <p>The group called on nearly 300 scientists from 160 cities to analyze an evolutionary adaptation in white clovers that grow in urban areas. They found that the city plants produce less hydrogen cyanide than clovers in nearby rural areas. Hydrogen cyanide is a defense mechanism for the plant, to keep it from getting eaten by hungry herbivores like rabbits or deer. </p>
                <p>Those hungry little critters are less populous in cities, thanks to human things like cars and noise. So the clovers don't need to protect themselves from predators as much. Hence, the reduced defense mechanism. </p>
                <p>The scientists turned their findings into an easy-to-understand animation. Watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrVeB3_Ln84&feature=emb_imp_woyt">here.</a> </p>

            <h3>American Goldfinch</h3>
            <p>There are two primary characteristics of cities that might affect bird species' migration patterns. </p>
            <p>First, cities tend to be warmer than surrounding areas. This phenomenon is known as the urban heat island effect. This happens because solar energy gets trapped by asphalt, black roofs, and other heat-holding materials that make up the basic infrastructure of most cities. </p>
            <p>Second, food for critters is plentiful in cities, whether it's spilled garbage or your neighbor's bird feeder. </p>
            <p>Migratory birds fly south to warmer temperatures in the winter so they can feed themselves. Because urban areas provide a "buffer" to those harsh winter conditions, ecologists have found that some species, like the American Goldfinch, are more likely to stay – that is, not migrate – in populous areas over the winter. </p>
            <p>"Bird migratory strategies will respond to global change – in climate and land use – and indeed are already doing so," wrote ecologist Anne-Sophie Bonnet-Lebrun in a 2020 <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03005340/document">study</a> she co-authored on the changing migratory patterns of city-dwelling bird species.</p>

            <h3>Microorganisms in the Gowanus Canal</h3>
            <p>City dwellers have not always been kind to their waterways – ask the Thames about having been declared "biologically dead" in the 1950s. One might be tempted to say the same about Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal, a former dumping ground for the city's industrial waste and current superfund site. But the Gowanus, while notoriously toxic, is far from dead. </p>
            <p>This 1.8-mile waterway has grabbed the attention and obsession of urban scientists, who have found, to everyone's surprise, a rapidly evolving ecosystem <em>within</em> the decades' worth of sludge on the canal floor. </p>
            <p>Somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of the DNA from the sludge-inhabiting microorganisms does not match known organisms – meaning, they might be newly evolved. New organisms appear to be evolving every twenty minutes, Elizabeth Hénaff, one of the lead scientists, told <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2022/04/gowanus-canal-cleanup.html">Curbed</a> in April. </p>
            <p>Most notably, some of the new microorganisms seem to have adapted the ability to degrade some of the most toxic components of the infamous Black Mayonnaise. </p>
            <p> Bonus: previously-unknown bacteria have also been found in NYC <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S2405471215000022?token=839E964B8AF041B95178421169367CCC9ED8F3E80F47F39CA213ECA735CD0A438E69C09D934C96E5D150BFBED6379D78&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20220524181159">subways.</a> </p>

            <h3>European Blackbird</h3>
            <p>If you live in a city, what sounds do you wake up to? Is it birdsong, or is it a train screeching by, followed by a car horn layered on top of a rumbling garbage truck? Maybe that birdsong is there, but in urban environments it's difficult to hear. Imagine, then, being a bird. </p>
            <p>Birds sing in order to claim territory or attract mates. Like with humans, communication among birds is a necessary biological function. </p>
            <p>In order to combat the city noise, common blackbirds in Spain were found to have altered the frequency of their song. This is a behavioral shift, but the researchers believe that it could lead to genetic changes – evolutionary adaptation. </p>

            <h3>Cherry Blossoms</h3>
            <p>The urban heat island effect – the same one that causes some birds to alter migratory patterns – affects all natural life cycles in cities. The study of these natural cycles is called phenology, and many plant enthusiasts have monitored how flower bloom times have shifted as cities get warmer. </p>
            <p>The blooming of flowers is a big event for people. Blossoms mark the coming of spring, the end of winter. In Japan, the cherry blossom festival in early spring is a massive celebration. Because cities have warmed, and because cherry blossoms are the focus of a massive cultural event, people have especially noticed that the iconic pink flowers are starting to bloom earlier and earlier. </p>
            <p>"When the cherry trees bloom at a certain time, that's a big holiday in Japan," said Peter Del Tredici, an ecologist at Harvard. "Now the date when the holiday occurs, it's long after the cherries have started blooming."</p>
